# This is usually supposed to be a dev-dependency. However, using it in `drun`
# greatly simplifies the code that parses input messages to `SignedIngress`
# messages that are delivered to Message Routing. `drun` is a tool that
# is meant to be used mostly for testing anyway, so this dependency
# should be fine.
