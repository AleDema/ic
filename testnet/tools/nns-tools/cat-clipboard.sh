    DIR: Directory containing text files (e.g. nns-governance.md).

    Takes the contents of all files, surounds them with six ticks, gives a
    heading to each (based on the file name), concatenates them all, and sticks
    the result in your clipboard.

    (You'll probably want to manually want to manually insert links to proposals
    afterwards.)
